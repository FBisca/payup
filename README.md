Technologies
============

I always try to use different architectures and libs while I'm developing these small projects.
 So all the implementations found here are experimental. ***Would love to hear comments and suggestions***

- Build Tools 3.0.0-beta2
- Using my own `MVVM` architecture composed of
  - Kotlin 1.1.4
  - Dagger2 with my own Dagger-Android implementation
  - RxJava2
  - DataBinding
  - Using new experimental `@Parcelize` from Kotlin 1.1.4, that might cause unexpected errors
